I simply can't resist sharing the [Fonus](https://www.fonusmobile.com/) service.

Fonus gives you **unlimited mobile data** [in over 100 countries](https://www.fonusmobile.com/coverage/). You also get a U.S. phone number with **unlimited calls and SMS** in **over 85 countries for free!**

<!-- more -->

Surprisingly, I haven't seen many people talk about this service. On the other hand, I've seen plenty of influencers promoting alternatives that, in my opinion, are far worse than Fonus.

The pricing is very competitive. My wife uses the $29.99/month plan, which includes 20 GB of global data (slowed after 20 GB), and I use the $49.99 unlimited data plan. No more stressing about finding Wi-Fi!

It's a game changer. I no longer have to swap or reinstall eSIMs when moving from country to country. So far, we've used it for over 100 days and everything has worked smoothly. Just glad I can finally share this with you.
